# Document-QA
# 📄 Document Intelligence Platform (RAG)

A full-stack **Document Question Answering System** built using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.  
This application allows users to upload PDF documents and ask natural-language questions, returning **accurate, citation-grounded answers** using a **local Large Language Model (LLM)**.

The system runs **fully locally**, ensuring **privacy, low latency, and zero dependency on paid cloud APIs**.

## 🚀 Key Features

-  Upload and process PDF documents
-  Intelligent text chunking with overlap
-  Semantic embeddings using SentenceTransformers
-  High-performance vector search using FAISS
-  Local LLM inference using **Phi-3 via Ollama**
-  Modern, professional Streamlit UI
-  Fully local & offline (no OpenAI / cloud APIs)

##  Why This Matters

- Demonstrates **end-to-end RAG system design**
- Uses **local LLMs** (no OpenAI / cloud dependency)
- Prevents hallucination via retrieval grounding
- Shows real understanding of:
  - vector databases
  - embeddings
  - LLM orchestration
  - backend + UI integration
